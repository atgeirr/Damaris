/**
 * The DataSpace class looks like a smart pointer that counts the
 * number of reference to a region of the memory, except that when
 * the count goes down to 0 it will call the Delete method of an 
 * "owner" object that has been passed to the DataSpace when
 * constructing it.
 * 
 * Just like most smart pointers, private operators "new" and "delete" 
 * of this class prevents it from being allocated on the heap (RAII).
 *
 * The main reason this class exists is to implement DataSpace<Buffer>
 * and for a Buffer to be responsible for its DataSpaces, which means
 * being able to track if the user has kept somewhere an instance of
 * its DataSpace in order not to delete it.
 *
 * The OWNER class of a DataSpace is expected to provide a Deallocate()
 * function taking a void* pointer to the memory to be deleted.
 * If the Deallocate() function takes something else such as a typed pointer,
 * the type can be provided as second template parameter of the DataSpace,
 * e.g. DataSpace<OwnerClass,DataType>.
 * 
 * The DataSpace class also contains a GetSize() function which gives the
 * size in bytes of the allocated memory. This size is only informative
 * and is never actually used by the owner.
 *
 * The DataSpace class only has a weak pointer to its owner, and will
 * check if it has expired before trying to use its Deallocate() function.
 * If the pointer has expired, then it will output a MEMORY LEAK trace.
