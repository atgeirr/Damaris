\chapter*{The \Damaris{} approach}

Large-scale simulations usually perform I/O in a time-partitioning manner.
They periodically stop and all processes perform a write (for checkpointing
or future analysis purpose) concurrently to a parallel file system. 
This approach has also been used to perform in situ visualization, 
where the simulation periodically stops to compute images.

On recent infrastructures, the large number of cores available in each SMP node makes
it possible to offload these tasks in order to gain efficiency by working 
in a space-partitioning manner.
\Damaris{} proposes to dedicate a subset of cores on each SMP node to perform these tasks,
or even to dedicate entire nodes.
In dedicated-core mode, it uses shared memory to transfer data from the cores 
running the simulation's code and the cores dedicated to these asynchronous,
data intensive tasks.

\Damaris{} can be enriched with new functionalities through a plugin system. 
Plugins can be written in C++ or Python, making asynchronous, 
in-situ data management straightforward for end-users.
Besides, \Damaris{} can be connected to the VisIt visualization software to provide
non-impacting, in situ, interactive visualization to existing simulations.

Version 1.0 of \Damaris{} corresponds to the version released by its author,
Matthieu Dorier, at the end of his PhD thesis.
