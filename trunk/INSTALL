 HOW TO COMPILE AND INSTALL DAMARIS
====================================

1) Install Boost 1.45 or greater with libraires "program_options"
and "date_time":

./bootstrap.sh --prefix=$HOME/deploy --with-libraries=date_time,program_options
./bjam
./bjam install

This will install the libraries and headers in $HOME/deploy.

2) Make sure you have CMake 2.8 installed (type cmake --version). Otherwise,
get the archive and install it.

3) Damaris requires HDF5 1.6 or greater.

4) Get Damaris. Edit the CMakeLists:
- line 9, edit if you used something else than $HOME/deploy for Boost.
- line 17, 18, 20 and 21, set appropriate paths for CMake to find HDF5 and ZLib.

5) Create the makefile:
   cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"

6) make

7) The Damaris client library is in client/ and can be linked using
   -L/path/to/damaris/client/ -ldamaris

8) The Damaris server is in server/.
   Starting a single client:
	./server --help
   will provide the needed argument. Typical command to start is
        ./server --id X -D --stderr=stderr.X.log --stdout=stdout.X.log
   Make sure X is different on each node!!!
   -D forces the server to run as a deamon, thus you can start
   the process remotely:
   ssh nodename /path/to/server --id X -D --stderr=stderr.X.log --stdout.X.log
   (loop over each node and start the server with a different X each time)
